<h2>Adding Shadow Effects to D3 Charts</h2>
<h3>August 8th, 2016 | by William Dickerson</h3>
<p>Let's say you have an area chart that shows sales over
time for some product:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="//jsfiddle.net/wilburrr90/msvrf4xt/3/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>There are two ways to interperet this chart. If it's a <i>stacked</i> area
chart, then to find the number of desserts sold on 6/1, you subtract 21 from 80. This would make sense if a scone is not considered a dessert. However, if a scone is considered a dessert, it might be better to use a <i>layered</i> area chart. In this case, we would see that, on 6/1, 80 desserts were sold and 21 of them were scones.</p>

<p>One way to emphasize that we have a layered area chart is to add a shaddow effect to each area. This indicates that both areas begin at the x axis, and that one is drawn in front of the other.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="//jsfiddle.net/wilburrr90/e8jedo5u/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>To create the shadow effect, we use <code>-webkit-filter: drop-shadow(1px -3px 3px gray)</code> on the appropriate SVG element, but there are some caveats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. For now, it only works in Chrome. In fact, having <code>-webkit-filter: drop-shadow(1px -3px 3px gray)</code> causes Safari to completely omit the SVG. To fix this, we also inclue <code>filter: none</code></li>
  <li>2. The <code>drop-shadow</code> filter can only be applied to an entire SVG element, so we must draw each of our areas in its own SVG element and align them.</li>
</ul>
